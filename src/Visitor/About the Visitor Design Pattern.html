<h1>The Visitor Design Pattern</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Allows you to add methods to classes of different types without
    much altering to those classes</li>
    <li>You can make completely different methods depending on the class used</li>
    <li>Allows you to define external classes that can extend other classes
    without majorly editing them </li>
</ul>
