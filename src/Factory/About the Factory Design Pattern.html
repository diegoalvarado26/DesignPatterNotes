    <title>About the Factory Design Pattern</title>
    <h1>The Factory Design Pattern</h1>
    <p>When a method return one of several possible classes
    that share a common superclass</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Create a new enemy in game</li>
        <li>Random number generator picks a number assigned
        to a specific enemy</li>
        <li>The factory returns the enemy associated with that number</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The class is chosen at runtime </p>

    <h3>When to use a Factory Pattern?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>When you don't know ahead of time what class
        object you need</li>
        <li>When all of the potential classes are in
        the same subclass hierarchy</li>
        <li>To centralize selectio code</li>
        <li>When you don't want the user to have to know
        every subclass</li>
        <li>To encapsulate object creation </li>
    </ul>

    <p>The <str>Factory Pattern</str> allows you to create objects
    withour specifying the exact class of object that will be created. </p>
