    <h1>The Iterator Design Pattern</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>The Iterator pattern provides you with a
        uniform way to access different collections of
        Objects</li>
        <li>If you get an Array, ArrayList and Hashtable of Objects,
        you pop out an iterator for each and treat them the same</li>
        <li>This provides a uniform way to cycle through different
        collections</li>
        <li>You can also write polymorphic code because you can
        refer to each collection of objects because they'll implement
        the same interface</li>
    </ul>
